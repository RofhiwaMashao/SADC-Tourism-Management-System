This project develops a Python-based tourism management system for SADC Tourism Connect. The system uses object-oriented programming to model countries, tourism experiences, tourist groups, and cross-border travel packages. It supports seasonal pricing, booking validation, inheritance for different experience types, and demonstrates how real-world tourism operations can be structured programmatically.
